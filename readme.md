# ATM

We're going to build an application to track checking and savings account
balances.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in the `src` directory. You are
required to turn in your submission by making a pull request on the original
repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 9:00am.

## Requirements

### Pseudocode

Spend up to 20 minutes writing some pseudocode. Think carefully about every step
involved in using an ATM. For example, it allows users to input a dollar amount
when they want deposit money. Also, think about how there are two types of
accounts -- checking and savings. Take a look at the **Specifications** below to
guide your pseudocode.

Include your pseudocode as comments within your program.

### Specifications

* Users can deposit money into an account
* Users can withdraw money from an account
* Account does not allow a negative balance
* The color of a bank account should reflect its balance. (There's a CSS class called `.zero` already written for this.)
* The two accounts have independent functionality

## Bonus

What happens when the user wants to withdraw more money from the checking account than is in the account?

* If a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, bring the withdrawn-from account down to $0 and take the remainder from the other account.
* If the withdrawn amount is more than the combined account balance, display an error.
